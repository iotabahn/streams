# Authors

A channel author is responsible for the generation of a new channel along with the configuration of the 
intended structure of that channel (i.e single branch vs multi branch). An author of a channel will be 
able to set the access restrictions to branches within a channel structure, as well as accepting and 
managing user subscription messages.
