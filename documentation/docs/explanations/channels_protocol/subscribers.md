# Subscribers 

A channel subscriber is any user within a channel that is not the author. A subscriber can be generated
independently without verification by an author, but in order to write to a branch, or to process any 
private streams, they will be required to subscribe to the channel, and have the author accept and process 
that subscription. A subscriber may also use pre-shared keys instead of subscription as a method of 
interacting with a stream without conducting a subscription process.
