# Contribute to the Project

Thanks for thinking about contributing to the project! Below are some ways that you can contribute.

## Join the IOTA Libraries Initiative

The [IOTA Libraries Initiative](https://github.com/iota-community/X-Team_IOTA_Streams) is a collaborative effort to help improve the developer experience through:

- Quality assurance and review.
- Documentation.
- Code samples.

If you would like to get involved, join the `#experience` channel on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/397872799483428865/701857063923351582).

## Contribute to the Project's GitHub Repository

All of our code is open source and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/iotaledger/streams) where you can:

- [Report a bug](https://github.com/iotaledger/streams/issues/new/choose).
- [Suggest a new feature](https://github.com/iotaledger/streams/issues/new/choose).
- [Contribute to the documentation](https://github.com/iotaledger/documentation/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Contribute to the Documentation

This documentation is also open source and hosted on GitHub.

If you want to contribute new documentation or fix an error, see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/iotaledger/documentation/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Share your Knowledge

Helping others is an important part of any open source ecosystem.

By sharing your knowledge with others, you can provide a lot of value to the community and maybe inspire someone else to learn and contribute.
